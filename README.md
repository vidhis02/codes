# Analyzing Flight Delay Trends Using ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo
Introduction:
Welcome to the repository dedicated to analyzing flight delay trends using the ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo. This dataset comprises comprehensive flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008. With nearly 120 million records, the dataset offers a rich resource for exploring various aspects of flight delays and their underlying factors.

Objective:
This project aims to address key questions regarding flight delays utilizing principles and tools from both R and Python programming languages. Through a structured approach, we will delve into different facets of flight delays and provide insights using data-driven analysis.
Questions to Explore:
When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimize delays?
Do older planes suffer more delays?
How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

Methodology:
Each question will be tackled systematically:
Data loading and cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring consistency and integrity.
Feature extraction: Extract relevant features such as flight timings, aircraft age, passenger volume, etc.
Data analysis: Utilize statistical methods, visualizations, and machine learning techniques to derive insights.
Interpretation: Provide interpretations of the findings and actionable insights.

Repository Structure:
Data: Contains the raw dataset and any supplementary information downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse.
Notebooks: Includes separate Jupyter notebooks for each question, demonstrating the analysis process in Python.
Scripts: Contains R scripts corresponding to each question, facilitating replication of analyses in R.
Reports: Houses structured reports in PDF format, detailing methodologies, findings, and interpretations for each question.
README: Provides an overview of the repository, instructions for replication, and acknowledgments.
